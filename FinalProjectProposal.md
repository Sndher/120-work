# Final Project Proposal

## Sound

For my final project, I want to experiment and implement sound into my sketch.

## Inspiration

Artists Surround Sound Project, music screen savers, wave forms, and other audio visual work.

## Goal

I would either like to implement some experimental sounds or music into the sketch and have the visualization come to live. Or I would like the viewer to be able to talk or make sounds into the microphone and see the result of the art visualization.
I would like to display the sound wave form either a rounded look or build more of a standard audio level graph.
Ideally, I would like to create a wave form or abstract sketch that changes with the sound instead of just displaying the audio levels.

## Process

First I will create my functions and a background of arrays so that I have multiple objects to create pattern within my sketch.
Then I will implement sound and try to get something to play when two objects interact, or I would like to get the music to control the sketch by changing with higher or lower frequencies.
