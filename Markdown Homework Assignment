# Homework Summary

For this week, I did additional study looking at the Terminal in Apple OS. I also did additional review from previous week material to help me complete the assignments using Atom and GitHub.

### Steps

I followed Dr. Musick's tutorials on the course website for MART120. By paying close attention to the steps. (https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-2/working-with-git/) I completed the files README.md and test1.txt by watching the tutorial videos, _Explained! GitHub_ and _What is GitHub?_ I also did a little experimentation with editing my files and checking back to the original repository.
###### Issue
While creating the repository for the GitHub Desktop I had moved the source file without realizing I would **break** the sync connection.
###### Solution
I then had to troubleshoot and recreate the file and link the documents back into the correct places.
