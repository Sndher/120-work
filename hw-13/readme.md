## Week 13

#Final Project

####Objective
For my final project my goal was to work with sound and create an equalizer or music analyzer. I wanted to create a sketch that would change with the beats of music.

####Study
I watched The Coding Train sound tutorial videos for references and guides. I also read chapter 13 in Make: Getting Started with p5.js by McCarthy, Reas & Fry. Read online troubleshooting guides in regard to setting up a local server. Studied FFT and frequency components.
