## Week 13

#Final Project

####Objective
For my final project my goal was to work with sound and create an equalizer or music analyzer. I wanted to create a sketch that would change with the beats of music.

####Study
I watched The Coding Train sound tutorial videos for references and guides. I also read chapter 13 in Make: Getting Started with p5.js by McCarthy, Reas & Fry. Read online troubleshooting guides in regard to setting up a local server. Studied FFT and frequency components and brief overview of algorithms.

###Problems
I have had a lot of struggle to get a sound file to play at all. I followed along with the Coding Train's tutorial videos along with other examples that I had found to see if I could even get the demonstration to work properly. I then tried the process again, but with using a local host server. I tried two different methods of local server and tried to troubleshoot chrome and firefox so that I would be able to allow the audio file. Still no success with sound files being implemented. I am not sure where I went wrong.

##Change of Plans
Because of my struggle with sound I have come to a different approach. I have had success with getting image files implemented into my sketch so I am going that route for the final.

##Success
I was able to easily implement an image to use for the background of my sketch! I did have to downsize the image so that it would reasonably fit within the canvas constraints.

#Secondary Issues
Could not get the snowflakes to fall at an individual rate where they would fall past the entire screen and regenerate at the top in a loop that was smooth. All of the snowflakes would disappear and then reappear at the same time during the beginning phase, but they would fall at different speeds due to the scale of the object.

##Goals for the Future
I want to continue to explore with p5 and with its capability to manipulate sound even though I was not successful this project in that aspect. I would love to be able to get whatever I was struggling with to be sorted out so then I can continue to explore what can be done with audio using the p5 reference guide.
