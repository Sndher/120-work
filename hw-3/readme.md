### HW-3 Response
## Intro
More Progress! I made much more success this week than I did last week.

I felt so much more capable of understanding what was happening with the coding.

## Experiments
This week I really liked working with changing the colors of of the canvas. My favorite greyscale was between (85 and 210).
