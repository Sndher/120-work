#### Week 5 Sketch

# Animation & Variables


["LIVE SKETCH"](https://sndher.github.io/120-work/hw-5/)

##### Successes
I did well at the translation animations that revolved around the movement of the mouse cursor on the X and Y axis. I also successfully did some basic form resizing that revolved around mouse movement.
#### Failures
I was not as good at understanding rotating axis and how to properly place them. I struggle to accurately isolate a shape from others and end up grouping multiple elements within the same rotating axis without meaning to.

### Guides
I reviewed the tutorials that were offered on p5.js and analyzed the sample code for the week.
