#### Week 6 Sketch
Shelby Decker
# Algorithmic Sketch


["LIVE SKETCH"](https://sndher.github.io/120-work/hw-6/)

##### Intro
For this week, I did more experimentation on the manipulation with the parameters of code.

Going into this sketch I felt very intimidated by learning new math functions.

### Guides
I reviewed the tutorials that were offered on p5.js and analyzed the sample code and other students sketch.js files for help. It helped me a lot to look at the sample code file for week 6.  I read the code blocks and studied the lesson materials to better understand this weeks changes.

### Success
I was able to create my own code using the sample code text as a guide. I wanted to do a sketch that would paint itself but then could be somewhat erased and manipulated by the user.
